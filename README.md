## Overview

I wanted to continue to practice my frontend skills without any CSS frameworks.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make the Mobile Design look like the design

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the
page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long
the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free
option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image
above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and
providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
